# Project Description 
This project demonstrates how to interface a 4x4 keypad with an Arduino to capture user input and display it on a serial monitor. By using the Keypad library, the program reads and processes inputs from a 4x4 matrix keypad with a layout including numbers, letters, and special characters. This setup can be useful for applications requiring user input for codes, menu selections, or simple numerical data.

# Features
1. 4x4 Keypad Layout: Configured with 16 keys arranged in a 4x4 grid (keys: 0-9, A-D, *, #), making it versatile for various input needs.
 2. Serial Monitor Display: Captures each key press and sends the character to the serial monitor for real-time feedback.
 3. Special Character Detection: When the â€˜Dâ€™ key is pressed, it triggers a new line in the output, making it suitable for marking the end of inputs or commands.


# Technical Details
1. Hardware Connections: The keypadâ€™s rows are connected to digital pins 6-9, and columns to pins 2-5.
2. Keypad Library: Utilizes the Keypad library to simplify the process of reading the keypad matrix and mapping inputs.
3.  Arduino Serial Communication: Uses serial communication for displaying the keypad inputs, facilitating monitoring and debugging in real-time.


# Conclusion 
This project is ideal for those new to Arduino projects, particularly those involving user interfaces. It serves as a foundation for more complex applications where user input through a keypad is needed, such as access control systems, calculators, or menu navigation interfaces.
