# Project Description
This project demonstrates a stepwise control mechanism for a servo motor using an Arduino. Through precise increments and decrements in movement, the code makes the servo motor move in a controlled sequence, allowing it to rotate between specified angles with a set delay. This project can be applied in robotics, automated systems, and precise positioning tasks.


# Project Overview

### Components:
1.  Servo Motor: Controlled by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals from the Arduino.
2.  Arduino Board: Supplies the control signals to adjust the motorâ€™s position.
3. How the Code Works:
4.  The code sets up a servo motor on pin 9 and gradually rotates it between 20Â° and 80Â° in increments of 20Â°
5. Then, the motor rotates back down, decrementing by 26Â° each step.
6. The loop includes two for loops, one to incrementally increase the angle and another to decrease it, with a 1-second delay after each position change.
7.  This back-and-forth rotation simulates a sweeping motion, useful in scenarios like radar systems, robotic arms, or camera panning mechanisms.


# Working Principle of a Servo Motor:

A servo motor is a type of actuator that precisely controls angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration. Internally, it consists of a motor coupled with a potentiometer and controlled by a feedback system:

 1. PWM Control: Servo motors respond to Pulse Width Modulation signals where the width of each pulse determines the motorâ€™s angle.
 2. Angle Control: By varying the pulse duration, we can control the motorâ€™s shaft position from 0Â° to 180Â°.
 3. Feedback Mechanism: The built-in feedback loop within the servo motor helps maintain its position based on the PWM input, ensuring accuracy even with external force.


# Applications:
 1. Robotics: Servos provide precise control for robotic arms or legs.
 2. Camera Systems: Used to pan and tilt cameras in surveillance or photography.
 3. Industrial Automation: Used in conveyor systems and automated assembly.



# Conclusion
This project highlights the fundamentals of servo motor control, enabling precise angular adjustments that can be applied in various automation and robotics projects.
