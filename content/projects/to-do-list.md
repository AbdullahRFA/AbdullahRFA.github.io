# Description

#### To-Do List Web Application

This is a basic To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add, check off, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved locally in the browser using localStorage, ensuring that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

1.	Add new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking the “Add” button or pressing Enter.
2.	Mark tasks as complete by clicking on the task. Completed tasks will be displayed with a strikethrough effect.
3.	Remove tasks by clicking the red delete button (×) next to the task.
4.	Tasks are saved in the browser’s localStorage to maintain the to-do list across browser sessions.

Technologies Used
1. HTML: Provides the structure for the to-do list.
2.	CSS: Adds styling and layout, including responsive design features.
3.	JavaScript: Handles the dynamic behavior of the to-do list, such as adding, removing, and saving tasks.

## How to Use

1.	Clone or download the repository.
2.	Open the index.html file in any browser.
3.	Start adding tasks using the input box and clicking “Add” or pressing Enter.
4.	Your tasks will be saved automatically in localStorage.
