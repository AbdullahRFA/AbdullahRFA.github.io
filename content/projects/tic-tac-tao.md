## Description
I recently built a fully responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve my skills in JavaScript, specifically in DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI interactions. This project showcases core front-end development concepts, along with:

# ðŸ”¹ Features 
 1. Player vs Player with alternating turns (O vs X)
 2. Winner and draw detection based on predefined patterns
 3. A clean, responsive design using flexbox for a great user experience on different devices
 4. Smooth transitions and hover effects for an enhanced UI

# ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
 1. HTML5 for structuring the game
 2. CSS3 for styling and responsiveness
 3. JavaScript for game logic and interactivity


# ðŸ”¹ Project Goals
 ### This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

 1. Writing clean, modular JavaScript code
 2. Implementing game logic with win/draw detection
 3. Using CSS to create an engaging and intuitive UI
