## Description

 I recently completed a project in JavaScript that enables users to generate a secure, randomized password with just a click! This user-friendly tool is built with a responsive design, clean UI, and efficient JavaScript code that incorporates HTML, CSS, and FontAwesome for added functionality and aesthetics.

# 🔹 Features

 1. **Password Generation:** The app generates a random, 20-character password each time a user clicks the “Generate Password” button. The password includes a secure mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
 2. **Copy to Clipboard:** After generating a password, users can copy it to their clipboard with a single click on the copy icon.
 3. **Interactive Animations:** The app includes smooth hover and rotation animations using CSS transitions to enhance the user experience.
 4. **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes, making it accessible on mobile and desktop devices alike.


# 🔹 Tech Stack

 1. **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the interface.
 2. **JavaScript​:** For implementing the password generation logic and clipboard functionality.
 3. **FontAwesome:** For icons, enhancing the UI without adding additional graphic assets.
