Relays are commonly used to control high-power devices with low-power control signals from microcontrollers like an Arduino. In this project, each relay is connected to a designated digital pin and activated one at a time in a set sequence, making it ideal for applications that need staggered control of multiple devices.\nProject Overview Components Used: 4 Relays: Each relay controls an electrical device connected to the system. Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino): Sends digital signals to control the relay states. Relay Pins Setup: Relay 1: Controlled by pin 3 Relay 2: Controlled by pin 4 Relay 3: Controlled by pin 5 Relay 4: Controlled by pin 6 Working Principle of Relays: Relay Structure: A relay is an electrically operated switch that uses an electromagnet to mechanically switch a circuit on or off. When a low voltage signal is sent to the relay‚Äôs input pin (from a microcontroller), it activates the electromagnet within the relay, closing or opening its contacts to control a high-power circuit. Relay Types: The relays in this project are typically normally open (NO) relays, meaning the circuit they control is open by default and closes when the relay is activated (relay pin set to LOW). The relay is turned ‚Äúon‚Äù by setting the digital pin to LOW, and it is turned ‚Äúoff‚Äù by setting the pin to HIGH. How the Code Works: Setup: Each relay is defined with a digital pin (3 to 6), and all are configured as outputs. In the setup function, all relays are set to HIGH to ensure they start in the ‚Äúoff‚Äù position. Loop: The loop sequentially activates each relay: Relay 4 is activated (set to LOW) while others remain off, and then turned off (set to HIGH) after 2 seconds. Relay 3 follows the same process, turning on for 2 seconds, then off. Relay 2 activates next for 2 seconds, then turns off. Relay 1 stays on for a longer period of 10 seconds before turning off. This sequence can control devices like lights, motors, or pumps in a timed pattern. Applications: Automation Systems: The staggered activation is useful for systems that require sequential operation of different devices, such as conveyor systems, irrigation systems, or even home automation.\nTiming Control: The code can serve as a timer-based control mechanism where devices need to activate in a specific order.\nConclusion This project provides an introduction to relay control, enabling the microcontroller to handle high-power devices safely and effectively.\nsource code: https://lnkd.in/gGFymeKa Group-06(Debashis Dhali.SHAH SULTAN, Abu Hurraira Abid)\nEdge IOT and Robotics course Instructor: Redwan Ferdous, PRINCE2¬Æ, CSCM‚Ñ¢\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/relay_module/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"credentials\"\u003eCredentials\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-documentationhttpswwwlinkedincompostsabdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-sequential-relay-control-for-device-activity-7258117049250381824-qbadutm_sourceshareutm_mediummember_desktop\"\u003eüîó \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-sequential-relay-control-for-device-activity-7258117049250381824-qbad?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\"\u003eDocumentation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-videohttpswwwlinkedincompostsabdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-sequential-relay-control-for-device-activity-7258117049250381824-qbadutm_sourceshareutm_mediummember_desktop\"\u003eüé¨ \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-sequential-relay-control-for-device-activity-7258117049250381824-qbad?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\"\u003eVideo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"project-description\"\u003eProject Description\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project demonstrates how to control four relays in sequence using a microcontroller.

The goal is to use ambient light levels to automatically control a light source, which could be applied in streetlights, home automation, or energy-saving lighting systems.\nProject Overview Hardware Components: Arduino, LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), and an LED (or external light). Functionality: The LDR sensor reads the ambient light intensity and adjusts the LED‚Äôs state based on a predefined threshold. When the light level falls below a specified threshold, the LED turns on, simulating an automatic light that activates in low-light conditions.\nHow it works ‚Ä¢ The LDR provides an analog value representing the ambient light level. ‚Ä¢ The Arduino continuously monitors this value; when it drops below 5 (indicating low light), it turns the LED on. Otherwise, the LED remains off. ‚Ä¢ This control is achieved with simple condition checks and a feedback delay for optimal performance.\nApplication This project is scalable to develop automated lighting systems for homes, streetlights, or other settings where responsive lighting is needed, helping to improve energy efficiency by minimizing unnecessary light usage.\nsource code : https://lnkd.in/gE8S_gj7 IOT_JU_Group_06_(Debashis Dhali, SHAH SULTAN, Abu Hurraira Abid) Edge IOT and Robotics course Instructor: Redwan Ferdous, PRINCE2¬Æ, CSCM‚Ñ¢\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/ldr/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"credentials\"\u003eCredentials\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-documentationhttpswwwlinkedincompostsabdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-automated-light-control-using-an-activity-7256946429275889667-7razutm_sourceshareutm_mediummember_desktop\"\u003eüîó \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-automated-light-control-using-an-activity-7256946429275889667-7RAz?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\"\u003eDocumentation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-videohttpswwwlinkedincompostsabdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-automated-light-control-using-an-activity-7256946429275889667-7razutm_sourceshareutm_mediummember_desktop\"\u003eüé¨ \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-automated-light-control-using-an-activity-7256946429275889667-7RAz?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\"\u003eVideo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"project-description\"\u003eProject Description\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project demonstrates a basic automated light control system using an Arduino, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), and an LED indicator.

Through precise increments and decrements in movement, the code makes the servo motor move in a controlled sequence, allowing it to rotate between specified angles with a set delay. This project can be applied in robotics, automated systems, and precise positioning tasks.\nProject Overview Components: Servo Motor: Controlled by PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals from the Arduino. Arduino Board: Supplies the control signals to adjust the motor‚Äôs position. How the Code Works: The code sets up a servo motor on pin 9 and gradually rotates it between 20¬∞ and 80¬∞ in increments of 20¬∞ Then, the motor rotates back down, decrementing by 26¬∞ each step. The loop includes two for loops, one to incrementally increase the angle and another to decrease it, with a 1-second delay after each position change. This back-and-forth rotation simulates a sweeping motion, useful in scenarios like radar systems, robotic arms, or camera panning mechanisms. Working Principle of a Servo Motor: A servo motor is a type of actuator that precisely controls angular or linear position, velocity, and acceleration. Internally, it consists of a motor coupled with a potentiometer and controlled by a feedback system:\nPWM Control: Servo motors respond to Pulse Width Modulation signals where the width of each pulse determines the motor‚Äôs angle. Angle Control: By varying the pulse duration, we can control the motor‚Äôs shaft position from 0¬∞ to 180¬∞. Feedback Mechanism: The built-in feedback loop within the servo motor helps maintain its position based on the PWM input, ensuring accuracy even with external force. Applications: Robotics: Servos provide precise control for robotic arms or legs. Camera Systems: Used to pan and tilt cameras in surveillance or photography. Industrial Automation: Used in conveyor systems and automated assembly. Conclusion This project highlights the fundamentals of servo motor control, enabling precise angular adjustments that can be applied in various automation and robotics projects.\nSource Code: https://lnkd.in/gms8Wfhh group-6 (Debashis Dhali, SHAH SULTAN, Abu Hurraira Abid) Edge IOT and Robotics course Instructor: Redwan Ferdous, PRINCE2¬Æ, CSCM‚Ñ¢\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/servo_motor/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"credentials\"\u003eCredentials\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-documentationhttpswwwlinkedincompostsabdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-stepwise-servo-motor-control-using-activity-7258481057715429376-cptautm_sourceshareutm_mediummember_desktop\"\u003eüîó [Documentation]https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-stepwise-servo-motor-control-using-activity-7258481057715429376-CPTa?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=member_desktop)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"-videohttpswwwlinkedincompostsabdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-stepwise-servo-motor-control-using-activity-7258481057715429376-cptautm_sourceshareutm_mediummember_desktop\"\u003eüé¨ \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abdullah-nazmus-sakib-04024b261_project-stepwise-servo-motor-control-using-activity-7258481057715429376-CPTa?utm_source=share\u0026amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\"\u003eVideo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"project-description\"\u003eProject Description\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis project demonstrates a stepwise control mechanism for a servo motor using an Arduino.
